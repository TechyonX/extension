## 💥 Spawn new particles with ease

Spawning particles is our way of creating something new. With just a few keystrokes, you can create a link, an image, or a long text that you want to refer back to or keep track of.

\* Tip: Try selecting a text or images in Finder, and run the command `spawn` 😉

## 🕹️ Manage your particles

Make it observable publicly, or keep them private – your choice. If you do not need to keep track of certain particles? Archive them.
